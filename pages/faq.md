They're not really that frequent.

## what's with the pricing model?

I just didn't feel like integrating the Stripe API. I also think it's
nicer this way. Not everyone might derive $5 (or any fixed amount) worth
of value from forlater; maybe you didn't save as many articles this
month to warrant paying $5. And some simply can't afford to pay a fixed
amount, or at all.

## how is this better than Pocket?

Let's see...

- You own your data. It lives right in your inbox!
- You don't need yet another account or app. Just simple email.
- We're open source!

That said, Pocket has a full-fledged engineering team working on it, so
their article parsing is probably better.

## are you tracking me?!

Nope. You can audit our code [here](https://github.com/forlater-email).
The email ID, and the link you saved are both logged for easier
debugging.

## are you open source?

Yes, as mentioned previously (twice!), we are open source -- licensed
under (A)GPL. See:

- https://github.com/forlater-email
- https://git.icyphox.sh/forlater

## you keep saying 'we'; how many of you are there?!

I'm just [one guy](https://icyphox.sh). 'We' just sounded right, I
guess. Feel free to email me at [x@icyphox.sh](mailto:x@icyphox.sh) to
report any issues.
